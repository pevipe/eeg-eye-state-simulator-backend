# Requirements
## hyperopt-sklearn
To install `hyperopt-sklearn`, the following command must be manually run:
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/hyperopt/hyperopt-sklearn
```
Although it could be automatically installed with the `requirements.txt` file, 
the version of the package (0.1.0) would not be compatible with versions of Python
3.11. Newer versions of the library, such as 0.1.3, are needed.
